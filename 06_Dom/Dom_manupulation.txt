So the heading text on the page will now display:
“Chai aur code”

3. Output:

html

In the given screenshot, JavaScript is used within the browser's console to manipulate the content of an HTML element. 
The `document.getElementById('firstHeading')` command selects the `<h1>` element with the ID `firstHeading`. 
Using the `.innerHTML` property, the content of that element is updated to display a new heading, "Chai aur code". 
This demonstrates how JavaScript can dynamically change the structure and content of a webpage in real time by accessing and 
modifying the DOM (Document Object Model). Such manipulation is useful for creating interactive and responsive web pages.
